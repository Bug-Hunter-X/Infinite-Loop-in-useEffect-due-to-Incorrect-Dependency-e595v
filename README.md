This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: including a state variable as a dependency that changes on every render, leading to an infinite loop.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises because the `useEffect` callback is invoked every time a dependency changes.  By incorrectly including `count` as a dependency, the effect triggers repeatedly, creating a never-ending loop of console logs and potentially freezing the application.
